let names: [String] = ["John Appleseed", "Bugs Bunny", "James Bond", "Dorothy Gale", "Forrest Gump"]

// Map: Take a [String] and return a [String] transformed by a closure of the form (String) -> String


// Filter: Take a [String] and return a [String] containing those elements that "pass" the closure of the form (String) -> Bool


// Reduce: Take a [String] and return a single "fact" of SomeType that comes from combining together
//      the elements of the array. The closure used to combine them is of type (SomeType, String) -> SomeType
